## Who Am I?

Certified CPA through CPA Canada and FMVA through Corporate Finance Institute. 

By trade, I'm a licensed CPA with 5 years of experience. Currently I am working for a SaaS company (Heap) in San Francisco. Beyond crunching numbers and working through endless Excel files, I have been bitten by a travel bug and I aim to travel to 30 countries by the time I turn 30. I am also a photographer.

I've spent the last few years learning about Blockchain, Cryptocurrencies, DeFi and DApps, and their impact on financial institutes and world of business through reading books and attending conferences/webinars. I'm very extroverted and have a down-to-earth personality. I enjoy playing basketball and volleyball but also can be found spending time exploring, reading and watching countless Netflix/Hulu/HBO/Prime series.
